# Facial-Recognition-System
A facial recognition system that can be used to authenticate website login attempts.

Using LBPH - Local Binary Pattern Histogram - We have created a facial recognition system that can be used to authenticate users whilst logging into websites.

The system stores 100 images when a new user registers themselves. When the user tries to login, the system will collect a real time photo and match it with the ones stored in the database.

If the photo matches, the user will be able to login, else the login attempt will fail.

There are no special implementation instructions. Just run views.py on your local server and use it like any other website.
